# Sprint Review

1. What is done?

We've updated our website with the following new features, as per our sprint plan:
1) The user can make an account by clicking on the SignUp button in the top-right corner of the website.
2) The user can sign in to their account using the same credentials they used to create it.
3) The user can also use the forgot password feature to reset his password.

2 . What has slipped?

We have raised the pull requests a little late, but other than that, we completed what we set out
to do until this week and are happy with the outcomes.

3. Feedback

According to us, we did a good job and were able to satisfy the user requirements for this sprint,
and we improved in the areas where we lacked in the previous sprint, and we are trying to solve
the things that we lacked in this sprint so that we do not repeat them in the future. And, we need
to update our user interface in future sprints
