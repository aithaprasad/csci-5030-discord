What is done?
We've added the following new features to our website as part of our sprint strategy.
1. The homepage has been designed to display the user's channels, chats, and username
of the user.
2. We've modified the homepage with a text area where registered users can input
messages to start conversations with other users.
3. Users can now create new channels and send messages in the channel and users can
view their conversations and the timestamp of the messages.

What has slipped?
1. The user-created channels on the sidebar are not clickable, which is something we need
to fix in the next sprint.
2. Utilization of web sockets in a perfect way

Feedback?
1. We need to update some of the frontend styling, such as font size, background color,
and text color.
2. The size of the chat messages in the discussion window has to be increased because it
appears to be too little.
